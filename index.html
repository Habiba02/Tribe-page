        <p>She  was well-versed in various religious sciences, Qur’an, hadith, as well as poetry and history. 
            Chroniclers describe her as being incredibly intelligent.
             The fact that she ruled in her own right as queen is underscored by 
             the fact that her name was mentioned in the khutba (Friday sermon) directly 
             after the name of the Fatimid caliph, al-Mustanṣir-billah. 
             Arwa was given the highest rank in the Yemeni Fatimid religious hierarchy (that of ḥujja) by the Fatimid caliph al-Mustanṣir.
            She was the first woman in the history of Islam to be given such an illustrious title and 
            to have such authority in the religious hierarchy.
            It was also during her reign that Ismā’īlī missionaries were sent to western India,
            where a major Ismā’īlī center was established at Gujrat (which continues to be a stronghold of the Ismā’īlī Bohra faith).
            She played a major role in the Fatimid schism of 1094, throwing her support behind al-Musta‘lī (and later al-Tayyib), 
            and it is a mark of her immense influence that the lands under her rule—Yemen and parts of India—would follow her in this. 
            Indeed, Yemen became the stronghold of the Tayyibī Ismā’īlī movement. Her reign was marked by various construction projects 
            and improvement of Yemen’s infrastructure, as well as its increased integration with the rest of the Muslim world.
            She was perhaps the single, most important example of an independent queen in Muslim history.
